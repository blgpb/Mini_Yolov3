LightNet* is a minimize inference neural network fork from Darknet. The goal of hacking is running simple and practical networks on lightweight mobile devices.

For now it's just a YOLOv3-tiny network running with high FPS (22ms/52mAP), and everything unrelated was dropped, including cuda computing, trainning period and some layers.

### Demo
If you want a simple object detection solution, try it by building C code and running detection demo. The detect function return a struct containing object names, probability and bounding boxs' axis. It works if you got predicition images like this,

###  Restful Server Demo

![](https://blog.keras.io/img/simple-keras-rest-api/dog.jpg)

~~~bash
#launch restful_server.py and testing rest api using curl 
#upload dog.jpg, and we got the detail of detection 
curl -X POST -F image=@dog.jpg 'http://localhost:5000/detect'
{
  "predictions:": [
    {
      "h": 56.46, 
      "label": "dog", 
      "prob": 73.18, 
      "w": 44.56, 
      "x": 47.93, 
      "y": 36.55
    }
  ]
}

### Features

- Small,  the core' size limited to 200kb
- Fast, written in C with performance optimization
- Hackable, thanks to the tiny size and understand it is easy
- Easy install, no external deps and just build by makefile in few seconds

### Future work

- Add more models and tasks
- Maybe NNPACK make it faster
- Make it easily for hacking 
- Wait deep learning suitable for engineer hacking ðŸ˜´ ðŸ˜´ ðŸ˜´
